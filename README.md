# NLP
In that repository presented solutions of some NLP and Computational linguistics problems, such as 
1) Part-of-Speech Tagging - assigning a grammatical category or part-of-speech label (such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each word in a sentence.
It was developed by using Hidden Markov Model and rule-based Viterbi algorithm.
3) Lemmatizer - the process of reducing the different forms of a word to one single form, for example, reducing "builds", "building", or "built" to the lemma "build".
5) Building own NLTK corpus

During developing these methods have been used "ru_syntagrus-ud-dev.conllu" treebank dataset, where each sentense was parsed from different sources and each word was tagged by pos, lemmas, morphology feature and Universal Dependencies(UD) syntax.
Real dataset consists of more than 1 million raws of parsed sentenses.(130 MB)
